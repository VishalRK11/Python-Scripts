Hello everyone,
        I'm sending the link of the official Summer Mission RnD Summer 2k18 Batch. All those who are interested kindly join the group through this link. The main motive of creating this group is to stay in touch with all of our batch mates. Let's enjoy and I miss you guys already. Thank you all of you guys for this wonderful experience and some amazing memories. These 27 days would be cherished for the rest of my life. Hope, to have a great time ahead too. All the best everyone.

PS: Once you are added, kindly introduce yourself so that it will be easy for everyone else to communicate.
